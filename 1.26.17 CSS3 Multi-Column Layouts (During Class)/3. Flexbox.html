            <div class="column">Computer science is the scientific and practical
            	approach to computation and its applications. It is the systematic
            	study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization
            	of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition,
            	representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information.
            	An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of
            	automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes
            	in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. ts fields
            	can be divided into a variety of theoretical and practical disciplines. Some
            	fields, such as computational complexity theory, are highly abstract, while
            	fields such as computer graphics and <b>Web Development emphasize real-world
            	visual applications</b></div>

			computers and internet to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data,[1] or
			an information often in the context of a business or other enterprise.</b> [2]
			IT is considered a subset of information and communications technology (ICT).
			In 2012, Zuppo proposed an ICT hierarchy where each hierarchy level "contain
			some degree of commonality in that they are related to technologies that facilitate
			the transfer of information and various types of electronically mediated
			communications."[3] Business/IT was one level of the ICT hierarchy.</div>


            <div class="column">Web development is a broad term for the work involved in
            developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).
            <b>Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain
            text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and
            social network services.</b> A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development
            commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client
            liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration,
            and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to
            the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding.</div>

						<div class="middleRow onTheRight">The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module
            (currently a W3C Last Call Working Draft) aims at providing a more efficient
            way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even
            when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").The main
            idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter
            its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space
            (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes).
            A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks
            them to prevent overflow.</div>

            <div class="middleRow">Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic
            as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline
            which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack
            flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications
            (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching,
            shrinking, etc.). <b>Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the
            components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid
